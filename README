Yet another SQLite binding based on:
 - original [Russ Cox's](http://code.google.com/p/gosqlite/) implementation,
 - the [Patrick Crosby's](https://github.com/patrickxb/fgosqlite/) fork.

Open supports flags.
Conn#Exec handles multiple statements (separated by semicolons) properly.
Conn#Prepare can optionnaly #Bind as well.
Stmt#Exec is renamed in Stmt#Bind and a new Stmt#Exec method is introduced to #Bind and #Step.
Stmt#Bind uses native sqlite3_bind_x methods and failed if unsupported type.
Stmt#Next returns a (bool, os.Error) couple like Reader#Read.
Stmt#Scan uses native sqlite3_column_x methods.
Stmt#NamedScan is added. It's compliant with [go-dbi](https://github.com/thomaslee/go-dbi/) API but I think its signature should be improved/modified.
Stmt#ScanColumn/NamedScanColumn are added to test NULL value.
