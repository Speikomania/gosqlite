Yet another SQLite binding based on:
 - original [Russ Cox's][http://code.google.com/p/gosqlite/] implementation,
 - the [Patrick Crosby's][https://github.com/patrickxb/fgosqlite/] fork.

Conn#Exec handles multiple statements (separated by semicolons) properly.
Stmt#Exec is renamed in Stmt#Bind and a new Stmt#Exec method is introduced to #Bind and #Step.
Stmt#Bind uses native sqlite3_bind_x methods and failed if unsupported type.
Stmt#Next returns a (bool, os.Error) couple like Reader#Read. But its use in for loop becomes inelegant...
Stmt#Scan uses native sqlite3_column_x methods.
Stmt#NamedScan is added. It's compliant with [go-dbi][https://github.com/thomaslee/go-dbi/] API but I think its signature should be improved/modified.
