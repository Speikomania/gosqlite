This is based on Russ Cox's original gosqlite package:

    http://code.google.com/p/gosqlite/

I added Scan2 and Exec2 which use sqlite api calls to get/bind values instead of the 
original which basically converted everything to strings.

Scan2 and Exec2 are significantly faster.  See the benchmarks in fgosqlite_test.go.
