Yet another SQLite binding based on:
 - original [Russ Cox's](http://code.google.com/p/gosqlite/) implementation,
 - the [Patrick Crosby's](https://github.com/patrickxb/fgosqlite/) fork.
This binding implements the "exp/sql/driver" interface but leaves dangling statements (see drivert_test).

Open supports flags.
Conn#Exec handles multiple statements (separated by semicolons) properly.
Conn#Prepare can optionnaly #Bind as well.
Conn#Close ensures that all dangling statements are finalized.
Stmt#Exec is renamed in Stmt#Bind and a new Stmt#Exec method is introduced to #Bind and #Step.
Stmt#Bind uses native sqlite3_bind_x methods and failed if unsupported type.
Stmt#NamedBind can be used to bind by name.
Stmt#Next returns a (bool, os.Error) couple like Reader#Read.
Stmt#Scan uses native sqlite3_column_x methods.
Stmt#NamedScan is added. It's compliant with [go-dbi](https://github.com/thomaslee/go-dbi/).
Stmt#ScanByIndex/ScanByName are added to test NULL value.

Currently, the weak point of the binding is the *Scan methods:
The original implementation is using this strategy:
 - convert the stored value to a []byte by calling sqlite3_column_bytes,
 - convert the bytes to the desired Go type with correct feedback in case of illegal conversion,
 - but apparently no support for NULL value.
Using the native sqlite3_column_x implies:
 - optimal conversion from the storage type to Go type (when they match),
 - loosy conversion when types mismatch (select cast('M' as int); --> 0),
 - NULL value cannot be returned, default value (0, false, "") is returned instead.

Maybe we should let the caller do the conversion.
